# Data Products Final Project

## Shiny Application
This Shiny application for the course is located in two files, the `ui.R` and `server.R`
source-code files. Together, these files contain a simple Shiny application demonstrating
how reactive input is handled to dynamically update the user-interface and plot `mtcars`
data using the `ggplot2` package.

## RPresentation
The `cars.Rpres` file is a slide-deck in RPresentation. It demonstrates some of the 
most important features to slide presentations such as in-line code execution and
rendering of plots (again using the `mtcars` dataset and the `ggplot2` package).
